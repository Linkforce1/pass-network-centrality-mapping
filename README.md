# Pass Network Centrality Mapping
The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze team passing structure using network theory — highlighting which players serve as central hubs and how the ball moves through different parts of the pitch.

This project explores how teams build and distribute possession by analyzing passing networks using soccer event data. By constructing directed graphs of completed passes for each match, we calculate centrality metrics such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality to measure how influential each player is within their team’s passing structure.

To go beyond network theory, we integrate advanced metrics like:
 - xG Chain: Credits a player for any involvement in a possession that leads to a shot.
 - xG Buildup: Measures a player’s contribution to build-up play, excluding shots and key passes.

Visualizations include annotated pass network maps and side-by-side comparisons with xG metrics to assess the relationship between player centrality and attacking output. This work can support tactical analysis, scouting, and team performance evaluation by identifying hidden playmakers and strategic tendencies.
